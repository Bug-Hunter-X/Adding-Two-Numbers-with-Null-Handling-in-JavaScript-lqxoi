# Adding Two Numbers with Null Handling in Javascript

This code demonstrates a simple JavaScript function that adds two numbers while gracefully handling null values. 

## Problem

The original function did not handle null or undefined inputs, causing unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The improved function explicitly checks for null or undefined inputs, returning null if either is encountered.  This prevents errors and provides a more robust solution. 

## Usage

You can use this function by calling it with two numeric arguments. If either argument is null, it will return null; otherwise, it will return their sum.
